1. SharePoint Solution
	- make it deployable
	- make it create some site structure
	- use some webparts / webcontrols
2. IOC
	- make sure it is useable in SharePoint webparts / usercontrols / etc.
	- make sure it doesn't throw exceptions all over the place
3. NHibernate
	- implement per-request lifestyle in SharePoint
	- use in webpart	
4. HttpModules
	- use some sane approach, so we won't have to update web.config all the time
	- maybe that injectable stuff from Windsor examples? hmmmmmm
5. External content type
	- how to use?
	- create some demo
6. ServiceFactory
	- is it possible to create custom service factory for SharePoint?
	- should use IOC to get its dependencies
	- if not possible, use some workaround 
		=> most probably extra object with same interface injected in service
7. Automapper
	- check why it cannot resulve data reader!
		- some googling maybe
8. Accesors
	- maybe merge few accesors together?
	- also how to approach problems like:
		"We need to access X sites from some webpart: OnDemandSiteAccesor? Or just standard using(var site = new SPSite("urlofsite")) ?
	- what about accesing other stuff? HttpContext, Cache, etc. ? all of them are statics, which can kill my nice app
