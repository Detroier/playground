- Projects should be somehow rearranged
- This really depends on what we want, but:
	- Root project
		- Only real stuff, no unity!
	- Infrastructure project?
		- Unity base classes can go here
	- Host project
		- references both projects and builds up whole app?
	- Test
		- Tests for all 3 projects

=> but, wouldn't we end up with truckload of projects?
